KEYMAPPER
=========
Train yourself with a custom keyboard layout
I made this to prepare myself to a 40% keyboard

USAGE
-----
Each keyboard row is represented by 4 lines of characters on the left.
You can activate each of the 4 lines using the following meta combo :
1. shift
2. ctrl+shift
3. *none*
4. ctrl
